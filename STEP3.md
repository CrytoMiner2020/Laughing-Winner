# The GridBee Framework

Now, let us take a look at the GridBee Framework, which is an open source library that allows web browsers to act as clients and communicate with BOINC. It is coded in JavaScript and the HaXe programming language.

Make sure to download [HaXe](https://haxe.org/) and [FlashDevelop](https://www.flashdevelop.org/). FlashDevelop is an IDE but is needed to compile the project file GridBee.hxproj.

If you are still in the clusterpost test folder then here is what to run in the terminal:  
```
$ cd ../
$ cd ../
$ cd gridbee-framework-old
$ cd GridBee
$ nauilus .
```  
Now you can see the project file GridBee.hxproj, right click it to open w/ FlashDevelop and press F8 to build.

You can also merge local storage with the BigChainDB that clusterpost is utilizing, and http requests to offload processes from your application and start optimally building a pipeline, but this is beyond the scope of this introduction.
